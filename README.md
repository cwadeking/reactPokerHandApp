# reactPokerHandApp

My current level of react skills are holding me back from making this an awesome little project.

Issues I need to fix-
Backend-
I've got a single endpoint with some hardcoded values created for testing, and I also have some schemas set up.  I need to sync this to the front end via axios whenever I finish up the functionality on the front
I need to set up roles, user schema, and secure login.
Functionality for queries and a gui to create those queries.

Frontend-
I need to make the components more responsive.  I built this on my 27" screen and where my old eyes could handle it.
I need fix the current modal that I have to manipulate a state object of an array of cards.  This way, when a card is selected for one place, it can't be used somewhere else.
I need to create some visuals for chip count based off of the player values.
I need to create another modal to alter properties of each individual player.
This will eventually create a JSON object that keeps track of all hands and each step of the hand.  Coaches will be able to query a user's hands to determine weaknesses and strength.
